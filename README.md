- **Current Season**: ~44 KB (2025 results)
- **Projections**: ~248 KB (8 weeks of FP data)

### Key Objects:
- `HISTORICAL_DATA` - Nested by format/year
- `SEASON_2025` - Current season with week-by-week scores
- `WEEKLY_PROJECTIONS` - FP projections indexed by week
- `FP_ACCURACY` - Calculated accuracy metrics per player
- `PROJECTIONS` - Final projections array (sorted by rank)

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Depth Limits:
In `renderRankingsTable()`, modify:
```javascript
const limits = { QB: 30, RB: 41, WR: 54, TE: 26 };
```

### Change Tier Thresholds:
In `calculateProjections()`, modify the tier assignment logic:
```javascript
if (rank <= 6) p.tier = 'Elite';
else if (rank <= 12) p.tier = 'High';
// etc.
```

### Add More Metrics:
Add to stats cards in `updateMetrics()`:
```javascript
{ label: 'Your Metric', value: PROJECTIONS.filter(...).length }
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Dashboard shows no players:**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify CSV files are in correct format
- Ensure player names match between files

**Sleeper connection fails:**
- Verify username is exact (case-sensitive)
- Check league ID is correct
- Ensure league is from current season

**Projections seem off:**
- Check `CURRENT_WEEK` value in data
- Verify weekly projection files loaded correctly
- Review FP accuracy calculations in console
