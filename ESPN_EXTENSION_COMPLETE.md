## 🚀 How It Works

### User Flow:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User installs extension] --> B[Configure League ID + cookies]
    B --> C[Click 'Fetch Roster']
    C --> D[Extension calls ESPN API]
    D --> E[No CORS! ✅]
    E --> F[Roster cached in extension]
    F --> G[Open dashboard]
    G --> H[Click 'Send to Dashboard']
    H --> I[Roster injected via custom event]
    I --> J[Dashboard highlights players]
```

### Technical Flow:

1. **Extension Popup** (`popup.js`)
   - User enters League ID, season, cookies
   - Fetches from ESPN API (no CORS restrictions!)
   - Parses roster data
   - Caches in `chrome.storage`

2. **Content Script** (`content.js`)
   - Injected into dashboard pages
   - Listens for messages from popup
   - Receives roster data
   - Dispatches `espnRosterLoaded` custom event
   - Injects into `window.USER_ROSTER`

3. **Dashboard** (your HTML)
   - Listens for `espnRosterLoaded` event
   - Extracts player names
   - Highlights rostered players
   - Shows success notification

---

## ✅ Installation Steps

### Step 1: Add Icons
Create 3 PNG files (see `ICON_GUIDE.md`):
- `icon16.png` (16x16)
- `icon48.png` (48x48)  
- `icon128.png` (128x128)

**Quick method**: Screenshot of 🏈 emoji, resize!

### Step 2: Load Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **"Developer mode"** (toggle, top-right)
4. Click **"Load unpacked"**
5. Select the `espn-extension` folder
6. Extension appears in toolbar!

### Step 3: Configure Extension

1. Click the extension icon
2. Enter your ESPN League ID (from URL)
3. For **private leagues**, add cookies:
   - Open ESPN Fantasy
   - Press F12 → Application → Cookies
   - Copy `swid` and `espn_s2`
   - Paste in extension
4. Click "Fetch My Roster"

### Step 4: Integrate with Dashboard

Add this code to your dashboard's JavaScript:

```javascript
// Listen for ESPN roster from extension
window.addEventListener('espnRosterLoaded', (event) => {
  const rosterData = event.detail;
  
  // Extract player names
  USER_ROSTER = rosterData.roster.map(p => p.name);
  ROSTER_SOURCE = 'ESPN';
  
  // Refresh tables
  renderProjectionsTable();
  
  // Show notification
  alert(`✅ ${rosterData.teamName} - ${rosterData.roster.length} players loaded!`);
});
```

See `DASHBOARD_EXTENSION_INTEGRATION.md` for complete code.

### Step 5: Test It!

1. Open your dashboard (GitHub Pages or localhost)
2. Click extension icon
3. Click "Send to Dashboard"
4. Verify roster highlights work! 🎉

## 🎯 Why This Solution is Better

| Approach | CORS Issues? | Backend Needed? | User-Friendly? | Self-Contained? |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Direct API Call | ❌ Blocked | ❌ No | ✅ Best | ✅ Yes |
| Python Script | ✅ Works | ❌ No | ⚠️ Requires setup | ✅ Yes |
| Backend Server | ✅ Works | ❌ Need server | ✅ Good | ❌ No |
| **Browser Extension** | ✅ Works | ❌ No | ✅ Great | ✅ Yes |

**Extension wins because:**
- ✅ No CORS issues (extensions bypass)

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized"
**Cause**: Private league without cookies  
**Fix**: Add `swid` and `espn_s2` cookies in extension popup

### Issue: "404 Not Found"  
**Cause**: Wrong League ID or year  
**Fix**: Double-check League ID, try 2024 instead of 2025

### Issue: Extension not injecting
**Cause**: Dashboard doesn't have event listener  
**Fix**: Add the `espnRosterLoaded` event listener code

### Issue: Names don't match
**Cause**: Name formatting differences  
**Fix**: Enhance `normalizePlayerName()` function in dashboard

### Issue: "No active tab found"
**Cause**: Dashboard not open  
**Fix**: Open dashboard before clicking "Send to Dashboard"
