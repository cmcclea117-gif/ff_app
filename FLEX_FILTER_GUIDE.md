## 🎯 Strategy Tips

### Tip 1: Cross-Position Comparison
```
Don't assume WR > TE for FLEX
Check reliability scores:
  TE with 85 reliability > WR with 70 reliability
Even if WR projected slightly higher!
```

### Tip 2: Waiver Wire FLEX Hunting
```
Use: Available + FLEX + 8+ PPG
Result: Best waiver adds that fit FLEX
Don't limit yourself to one position
```

### Tip 3: Injury Fill-In
```
When starter gets hurt mid-week:
1. FLEX filter
2. Available only
3. Min Games 3+ (include recent callups)
4. Sort by reliability
→ Best emergency FLEX option
```

### Tip 4: Trade Evaluation
```
Comparing trade offers across positions:
Their RB (80 reliability)
vs
Your WR (85 reliability)

Use FLEX filter to see percentile ranks
Higher reliability = more valuable
```

## 📈 Example Scenario

### Full Workflow: Filling Your FLEX Slot

**Sunday Morning Decision:**

**Step 1: Check Your Options**
```
Filters:
- Position: FLEX
- Roster Status: Rostered
- Min Games: 5+

Result:
⭐ Travis Etienne (RB)   🟡 83  (14.2 proj)
⭐ Jordan Addison (WR)   🟡 86  (13.5 proj)
⭐ Dalton Kincaid (TE)   🟠 71  (12.8 proj)
```

**Step 2: Compare Reliability**
```
Jordan Addison: 86 reliability (highest)
Travis Etienne: 83 reliability (high)
Dalton Kincaid: 71 reliability (fair)
```

**Step 3: Factor in Projections**
```
Etienne projected 14.2 (0.7 higher than Addison)
Addison has 3 points higher reliability

Close call, but Etienne's projection edge is small
Reliability difference is meaningful
```

**Step 4: Decision**
```
Start: Jordan Addison
Why: 
- Only 0.7 points less projected
- 3 points higher reliability (86 vs 83)
- More consistent performance
- Safer floor
```
