# Power Curve Implementation Summary

## ✅ Changes Made

Updated `generate_dashboard_fixed.py` to use the **Power Curve** formula for accuracy scores.

### Formula
```javascript
accuracyScore = Math.max(0, 100 - Math.pow(mae * 0.5, 1.3))
```

### Location in Code
**Line 1982** in `generate_dashboard_fixed.py`

### Color Coding Thresholds (Updated)
- 🟢 **High Accuracy**: Score ≥ 90 (top 27% of players)
- 🟡 **Medium Accuracy**: Score 75-89 (middle 42% of players)  
- 🔴 **Low Accuracy**: Score < 75 (bottom 31% of players)

### By Percentile
| Percentile | Score | Approx. MAE |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 100th (Best) | 97.9 | 3.6 |
| 90th | 93.8 | 8.1 |
| 75th | 90.5 | 11.3 |
| **50th (Median)** | **83.8** | **17.0** |
| 25th | 72.5 | 25.7 |
| 10th | 58.2 | 35.3 |

## 💡 Why This Formula Works

### ✅ Advantages
1. **Rewards Excellence**: Best performers get scores in the high 90s (97-98)
2. **Intuitive for Users**: Scores align with academic grading expectations
3. **Good Spread**: 
   - Top quartile: 90-98 (A range)
   - Middle 50%: 73-90 (B-A range)
   - Bottom quartile: 12-73 (wide range for differentiation)
4. **Non-linear Compression**: Gently compresses high scores while maintaining differentiation at all levels

### 📈 Score Characteristics
- **Median player** scores **84** (solid B) - feels rewarding
- **Top performers** reach **97-98** (near-perfect A+) - aspirational
- **Poor performers** drop significantly (<50) - clear feedback
- **Smooth curve** without harsh cliffs or plateaus

### 🎯 User Experience Impact
Users will see:
- Most players scoring 70-95 (familiar grade range)
- Clear differentiation between accuracy levels
- Positive reinforcement (higher base scores than exponential)
- Meaningful gaps between performance tiers

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. Run `generate_dashboard_fixed.py` to create updated HTML dashboard
2. Verify accuracy scores display correctly in the "Historical Reliability" tab
3. Test color coding (green/yellow/red) for different score ranges
4. Consider adding score explanations in the UI tooltip (e.g., "Score: 84 (median performer)")
