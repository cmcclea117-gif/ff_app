   - `android-chrome-192x192.png` ‚Üí (resize to 48x48 and 128x128)

---

6. Export as PNG

## Option 4: Temporary Placeholder

For testing, you can use **solid color squares**:

1. Open any image editor
2. Create a new image:
   - 128x128, 48x48, 16x16
   - Fill with a color (e.g., blue #0066cc)
   - Add white text "ESPN"
3. Save as PNG

---

## Quick Command Line (If you have ImageMagick):

```bash
cd espn-extension/icons

# Create a simple colored icon with text
convert -size 128x128 xc:"#0066cc" -gravity center -pointsize 40 -fill white -annotate +0+0 "ESPN" icon128.png

# Resize for other sizes
convert icon128.png -resize 48x48 icon48.png
convert icon128.png -resize 16x16 icon16.png
```

---

## Required Files:

Place these 3 files in `espn-extension/icons/`:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

---

## üé® Design Tips:

- **Keep it simple** - icons are small
- **High contrast** - easy to see in toolbar
- **Football theme** - üèà makes it obvious
- **PNG format** - with transparency
- **Consistent style** - all 3 sizes should match

---

## ‚úÖ Once You Have Icons:

1. Put all 3 PNG files in `/espn-extension/icons/`
2. Load extension in Chrome
3. You'll see your icon in the toolbar!

**Don't worry too much about perfection** - even a simple emoji screenshot works great for testing! üèà
