# 🆕 Reliability Tab v2.1 - Update Guide

## What's New

### 1. 🏆 Top 20 Overall/Available Toggle

The Top 20 grid now has two modes accessible via buttons at the top-right:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🏆 Top 20 Most Reliable Players    [🌍 Overall] [💎 Available] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 🌍 Overall Mode (Default)
- Shows the top 20 most reliable players **league-wide**
- Includes all players (rostered and available)
- Your rostered players marked with ⭐
- Best for: Benchmarking, seeing league-wide talent, identifying trade targets

#### 💎 Available Mode
- Shows the top 20 most reliable **available** players only
- Excludes all rostered players
- No stars needed (all shown players are available)
- Best for: Waiver wire research, finding adds, streaming options

---

## 2. 📊 Smart Filter Integration

The Top 20 grid now responds to these specific filters:
- ✅ **Position** (QB/RB/WR/TE/All)
- ✅ **Min Games** (3+/5+/7+)
- ✅ **Min Avg Points** (All/5+/8+/10+/12+/15+)

The Top 20 grid does NOT respond to:
- ❌ **Search** (table-only filter)
- ❌ **Roster Status** (use Overall/Available toggle instead)

### Why This Matters

**Before:** Top 20 always showed the same players regardless of your needs

**After:** Top 20 adapts to your analysis:
```
Example 1: Finding Reliable QB Streamers
  - Click "💎 Available"
  - Set Position: QB
  - Set Min Games: 5+
  → See top 20 available QBs with proven reliability

Example 2: Comparing Your WRs to Elite
  - Click "🌍 Overall"
  - Set Position: WR
  - Set Min Games: 7+
  → See where your WRs (⭐) rank vs. league's best
```

## 3. 🎛️ Horizontal Filter Layout
