## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No ESPN cookies found"
**Problem:** You're not logged into ESPN  
**Fix:** Open ESPN Fantasy in a tab and log in first

### "Could not find League ID in URL"
**Problem:** Not on league page  
**Fix:** Navigate to your league's home page (URL should have `leagueId=`)

### "ESPN redirected to login"
**Problem:** Cookies expired or year doesn't exist  
**Fix:** 
1. Log out and back into ESPN
2. Click "Auto-Detect" again to get fresh cookies
3. Try year 2024 instead of 2025

### Extension doesn't auto-detect
**Problem:** Extension needs permission  
**Fix:** When you click "Auto-Detect", Chrome may ask for permission - click "Allow"
