## 📊 Part 1: The Reliability Score

### What It Is
A comprehensive 0-100 score that tells you: **"How much should I trust this projection?"**

### The Formula
```
Reliability Score = 
  40% MAE Component (accuracy)
+ 30% Correlation Component (direction)
+ 20% Consistency Component (predictability)
+ 10% Sample Size Bonus (confidence)
```

### The Tiers
- 🟢 **90-100 (Elite):** Trust completely
- 🟡 **75-89 (Good):** Reliable guidance
- 🟠 **60-74 (Fair):** Use with caution
- 🔴 **<60 (Poor):** High variance, risky

### Why It's Better Than Your Old System
✅ Weighted composite (not just correlation)
✅ Measures error magnitude (not binary)
✅ Rewards consistency (predictable variance)
✅ Sample size bonus (more games = more trust)
✅ Intuitive 0-100 scale (easy to understand)

**Your old formula:** `0.5 + (accuracies) / divisor` → confusing 0.5-1.5 scale
**New formula:** Comprehensive weighted score → intuitive 0-100 scale

## 🏆 Part 2: Top 20 Visualization

### What It Shows

## 🎯 Real-World Example: Week 8 Decisions

### Scenario: You need to decide your WR3

**Your Options:**
- Jordan Addison (projected 13.2)
- Terry McLaurin (projected 13.8)

**Step 1: Apply Filters**
```
Position: WR
Roster Status: Rostered
Search: "addison" → Note his stats
Search: "mclaurin" → Note his stats
```

**Step 2: Compare**
```
Jordan Addison:
  🟡 86 reliability
  4.2 MAE
  81% correlation
  +1.8 bias (slightly overranked)

Terry McLaurin:
  🟠 68 reliability
  8.2 MAE
  54% correlation
  +3.4 bias (more overranked)
```

**Step 3: Decision**
✅ **Start Jordan Addison**

**Why:**
- 18 points higher reliability (86 vs 68)
- Half the MAE (4.2 vs 8.2)
- Better correlation (81% vs 54%)
- Less overranked (+1.8 vs +3.4)
- Even though McLaurin projected 0.6 higher, Addison's projection is more trustworthy
