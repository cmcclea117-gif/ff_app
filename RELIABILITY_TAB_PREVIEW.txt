📊 Understanding Reliability Metrics

Reliability Score (0-100): Composite metric combining accuracy, consistency, 
and sample size. Higher is better!

  • 90+: 🟢 Elite - Trust these projections
  • 75-89: 🟡 Good - Reliable with minor variance  
  • 60-74: 🟠 Fair - Use with caution
  • <60: 🔴 Poor - High unpredictability

## 🔍 Reading the Table

### Color Zones

**🟢 Elite Tier (97-94)**
- **Ladd McConkey:** Near-perfect projections, only 2.1 ranks off on average
- **Jake Ferguson:** Even better at 0.8 MAE, incredibly consistent
- **Breece Hall:** Bell cow RB, predictable usage = reliable projections
- **Ja'Marr Chase:** Elite WR1, experts nail him weekly

**🟡 Good Tier (86-76)**
- **Jordan Addison:** Solid but some variance week-to-week
- **Travis Etienne:** Committee concerns create small errors
- **George Kittle:** TEs are harder to project, still pretty good
- **Rashid Shaheed:** Big plays mean some boom/bust, but trending right direction

**🟠 Fair Tier (68-61)**
- **Terry McLaurin:** Mediocre QB play = unpredictable game scripts
- **Tyler Lockett:** Secondary WR role = target variance
- **Gus Edwards:** Committee back, experts struggle to project touches

**🔴 Poor Tier (58-44)**
- **K.J. Osborn:** Deep on depth chart, usage too inconsistent
- **Jaxon Smith-Njigba:** Rookie, experts still learning his role
- **Raheem Mostert:** Three-way committee = projection nightmare
- **Evan Engram:** Most unreliable TE, 14+ rank error on average

## 📊 Column Explanations

### ⭐ Reliability (Primary Metric)
- **What it is:** Your "confidence score" (0-100)
- **How to use:** Higher = trust the projection more
- **Threshold:** 85+ for must-trusts, 60- for don't trusts

### MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- **What it is:** Average rank difference between projected and actual
- **How to read:** Lower is better
  - 0-3 = Elite accuracy
  - 4-7 = Good accuracy  
  - 8-12 = Fair accuracy
  - 13+ = Poor accuracy
- **Example:** MAE of 5.0 means player finishes ~5 ranks different than projected

### Corr% (Correlation)
- **What it is:** How well projections move with results (0-100%)
- **How to read:** Higher is better
  - 85%+ = Very strong relationship
  - 70-84% = Good relationship
  - 50-69% = Weak relationship
  - <50% = Poor/no relationship
- **Example:** 90% correlation = when projection goes up, actual result usually goes up

### Consistency
- **What it is:** How predictable the errors are (0-100%)
- **How to read:** Higher is better
  - 85%+ = Very consistent errors
  - 70-84% = Moderately consistent
  - 50-69% = Somewhat erratic
  - <50% = Wildly unpredictable
- **Example:** 90% consistency = errors are usually similar size (predictable variance)

### Bias
- **What it is:** Average rank difference (positive = overranked, negative = underranked)
- **How to read:**
  - Negative (-) = Player beats projections (📈 good!)
  - Near 0 = Unbiased projections
  - Positive (+) = Player misses projections (📉 bad)
- **Example:** -2.1 bias = player typically finishes ~2 ranks better than projected

## 🎯 Decision Examples

### Example 1: Start/Sit Between Two WRs

**Scenario:** Jordan Addison (WR, projected 13.2) vs Terry McLaurin (WR, projected 13.8)

**Analysis:**
```
Jordan Addison:  🟡 86 reliability, 4.2 MAE
Terry McLaurin:  🟠 68 reliability, 8.2 MAE
```

**Decision:** **Start Jordan Addison**
- His reliability is 18 points higher (86 vs 68)
- His MAE is half of McLaurin's (4.2 vs 8.2)
- Even though McLaurin is projected 0.6 points higher, Addison's projection is more trustworthy
- Real outcome is more likely to favor Addison

---

### Example 2: Trade Target Selection

**Scenario:** You want to trade for a consistent TE. Options are Jake Ferguson and Evan Engram.

**Analysis:**
```
Jake Ferguson:  🟢 97 reliability, 0.8 MAE, -0.3 bias
Evan Engram:    🔴 44 reliability, 14.3 MAE, +12.1 bias
```

**Decision:** **Target Jake Ferguson**
- Elite reliability (97) vs terrible (44)
- Near-perfect accuracy (0.8 MAE) vs awful (14.3 MAE)
- Slightly beats projections (-0.3) vs massively underperforms (+12.1)
- You know exactly what you're getting with Ferguson
- Engram is a weekly guessing game

---

### Example 3: GPP Tournament Contrarian Play

**Scenario:** You want a high-upside, low-owned play for GPP. Looking at similar-priced RBs.

**Analysis:**
```
Travis Etienne:   🟡 83 reliability, 14.8 avg pts, +2.4 bias (chalk play)
Raheem Mostert:   🔴 48 reliability, 8.3 avg pts, +11.2 bias (contrarian)
```

**Decision:** **Use Mostert as leverage**
- Much lower reliability = experts don't know how to rank him
- Massive positive bias (+11.2) = consistently overrated
- BUT: This means when he hits, he'll massively outperform ownership
- High variance = perfect for GPP tournament
- Etienne is "safer" but won't give you unique leverage

---

### Example 4: Cash Game vs GPP Strategy

**Cash Games (need floor):**
```
Target: 🟢 Elite Tier (90+)
Examples:
  • Ladd McConkey (97)
  • Jake Ferguson (97)
  • Breece Hall (94)

Strategy: Stack your lineup with high-reliability players
Goal: Minimize variance, maximize consistent scoring
```

**GPP Tournaments (need ceiling):**
```
Core: 🟢 Elite Tier (90+) for stability
Leverage: 🟠🔴 Fair/Poor Tier (50-70) for upside
Examples:
  • Core: Ja'Marr Chase (92)
  • Leverage: J.Smith-Njigba (52)
  • Leverage: K.J. Osborn (58)

Strategy: Stable core + volatile leverage plays
Goal: Unique lineup construction, differentiated scoring
```

## 🎨 Sorting Examples

### Sort by Reliability (Default)
```
Click "⭐ Reliability" header → Highest reliability first
Use case: Find the most trustworthy projections
Perfect for: Start/sit decisions, cash game builds
```

### Sort by MAE
```
Click "MAE" header → Lowest error first (auto-inverted)
Use case: Find the most accurate projections
Perfect for: When you want raw accuracy over composite score
```

### Sort by Bias
```
Click "Bias" header → Most negative first
Use case: Find undervalued players who beat projections
Perfect for: Identifying draft steals, buy-low trade targets
```

### Sort by Avg Pts
```
Click "Avg Pts" header → Highest scoring first
Use case: Find high-volume players
Perfect for: When volume matters more than projection accuracy
```

---

## 💡 Advanced Tips

### Reliability + Bias Strategy
```
🎯 Target: High Reliability + Negative Bias
Example: Ladd McConkey (97 reliability, -2.1 bias)
Meaning: Experts are accurate BUT consistently underrate him
Action: Start with confidence, possible draft steal next year
```

### Consistency Analysis
```
🎯 Look for: Low Consistency + High Avg Pts
Example: (hypothetical) Player X - 65 consistency, 15.0 avg pts
Meaning: High scorer but wildly unpredictable week-to-week
Action: Perfect GPP leverage, avoid in cash games
```

### Sample Size Warning
```
⚠️ Warning: Games < 5
Reliability scores are less stable with limited data
Action: Wait 2-3 more weeks before fully trusting the score
```
