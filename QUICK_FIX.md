# 🚀 QUICK FIX - 30 Second Guide

## Your Problem:
- ❌ Projections showing 326.0, 325.0 (way too high)
- ❌ MAE showing 230.60 (nonsense)
- ❌ Rankings tab crashes
- ❌ Historical tab empty

## The Cause:
Your CSV has **Expert Consensus Rankings**, not point projections.

## The Fix (ONE COMMAND):
```bash
python3 patch_dashboard.py fantasy_dashboard_v34_complete.html
```

This creates: `fantasy_dashboard_v34_complete_patched.html`

## What Changes:
1. ✅ ECR ranks converted to realistic point projections (15-30 range)
2. ✅ MAE now measures rank accuracy (1-5 range)
3. ✅ All JavaScript bugs fixed
4. ✅ Correlation analysis tracks how reliable ECR is

## Open This:
```bash
open fantasy_dashboard_v34_complete_patched.html
# or double-click in file explorer
```

## What You'll See:
- **Projections:** 15-30 points (realistic!)
- **FP Accuracy:** 60-90% (correlation)
- **MAE:** 1-5 (rank accuracy)
- **Avg Diff:** ±0.5 (performance vs rank)

## How to Read Results:

### High Correlation (85%+) = Trust ECR
```
Lamar Jackson  QB  26.2 pts  [Elite]  85%  ✅ Reliable
```

### Low Correlation (50-70%) = Be Cautious
```
Breece Hall    RB  15.2 pts  [Mid]    58%  ⚠️ Unreliable
```

### Negative Avg Diff = Outperforms
```
Bijan Robinson  avgDiff: -1.2  ✅ Better than rank suggests
```

### Positive Avg Diff = Underperforms  
```
Travis Kelce    avgDiff: +2.1  ⚠️ Worse than rank suggests
```
