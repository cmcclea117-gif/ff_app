# ESPN API CORS Issue - Solutions

## ðŸš¨ The Problem

You're getting:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://fantasy.espn.com/...' from origin 'null' 
has been blocked by CORS policy
```

This happens because:
1. You opened the HTML file directly (`file://` protocol)
2. ESPN's API doesn't allow requests from `file://` origins
3. Browser security blocks the request

## âœ… Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Python HTTP Server (EASIEST - RECOMMENDED)

**Run this in your project folder:**

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd c:\Users\chrismccleary\Documents\ff_app

# Start a simple HTTP server
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open in browser:
```
http://localhost:8000/espn_api_test.html
```

**Why this works**: Requests now come from `http://localhost` instead of `file://`, which ESPN allows.

---

### Option 2: Add to Your Existing Dashboard (BEST FOR PRODUCTION)

Since your main dashboard is already a single HTML file, we can add ESPN support directly to it. The dashboard generator creates an HTML that can be opened directly OR served via HTTP.

**This bypasses the issue because**:
- The dashboard can be opened locally (`file://`) 
- ESPN API calls happen from user interaction
- We handle CORS using a different approach (see below)

### Option 3: Use a CORS Proxy (TEMPORARY WORKAROUND)

Update the test file to use a proxy:

```javascript
// Add this function at the top of the script
async function fetchWithProxy(url, options = {}) {
  // Use a CORS proxy service
  const proxyUrl = 'https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=';
  const proxiedUrl = proxyUrl + encodeURIComponent(url);
  
  return fetch(proxiedUrl, options);
}

// Then change the fetch call to:
const response = await fetchWithProxy(url, {
  method: 'GET',
  credentials: 'omit'
});
```

**Warning**: This is temporary and not ideal for production. Use Option 1 or 2.

## ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDED: Test via Python Server

Since you already have Python installed, this is the easiest:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Open PowerShell/Command Prompt**
2. **Navigate to your project:**
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\chrismccleary\Documents\ff_app
   ```

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

4. **You should see:**
   ```
   Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
   ```

5. **Open in your browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/espn_api_test.html
   ```

6. **Test your ESPN connection**

7. **When done, press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server**

## ðŸ”§ Alternative: Update Test File with Proxy

If you can't run a Python server, I'll create an updated test file with CORS proxy built in.
